## Open-source vs Commerical version

This repository contains the **research/core simulation** version of ERAIASON.

The commercial version includes the core plus additional **product features and polish** (e.g., UI/UX, onboarding, presets, audio options, and other quality-of-life improvements). The open-source version is not intended to be feature-parity with the commercial build, and some features may remain closed-source.

The open-source core is useful for educational purposes and experimentation.

If you submit a pull request, you agree that your contribution is licensed under this repository's license and may be included in the commercial build.
